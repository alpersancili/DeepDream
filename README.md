# DeepDream

About the Project
DeepDream is a creative application of neural networks, originally developed by Google, that produces dream-like, surreal imagery by amplifying patterns in the input image. The process leverages the internal representations learned by a neural network, revealing how the network interprets visual data.

Key Features:
Image Preprocessing: Inputs an image and prepares it for the DeepDream process.
Layer Selection: Allows targeting specific layers of the CNN to control the dream intensity and style.
Iterative Gradient Optimization: Modifies the image based on the gradients of the selected layer's activations.
Output Customization: Produces vivid, dream-like images with customizable parameters such as octave scaling and iteration count.
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for the CNN model and layer manipulation)
OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive implementation and visualization)
How It Works
Load Pretrained Model: The project uses a pretrained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3) to analyze and enhance image features.
Select Target Layers: Define which layers' activations will influence the DeepDream process.
Generate Dream: Use gradient ascent to iteratively adjust the input image, amplifying features identified by the network.
Visualize Results: Display and save the transformed image with surreal enhancements.
